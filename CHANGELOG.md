## [2.0.4]
### Changed
- Bump `@metamask/superstruct` from `^3.0.0` to `^3.1.0` ([#79](https://github.com/MetaMask/abi-utils/pull/79), [#80](https://github.com/MetaMask/abi-utils/pull/80))
- Bump `@metamask/utils` from `^8.5.0` to `^9.0.0` ([#80](https://github.com/MetaMask/abi-utils/pull/80))

### Fixed
- Replace dependency `superstruct` with `@metamask/superstruct` `^3.0.0` ([#73](https://github.com/MetaMask/abi-utils/pull/73))

  - This adds a new function `encodePacked`, which matches the behaviour of `abi.encodePacked` in Solidity
